# Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

Welcome to the Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier project! This repository contains code for a machine learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the training and testing image datasets are not included in this repository.

## Dataset
The training and testing image datasets can be downloaded from the following Kaggle link:
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

Please download the datasets and extract them into the `train` and `test` folders within the project directory before running the code.

## Project Structure
- `svm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for training and testing the image classifier.
- `svm_dog_cat_classifier.pkl`: Pre-trained SVM model saved using Joblib.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for downloading the dataset.

## Instructions
1. Download the training and testing datasets from the Kaggle link provided above.
2. Extract the contents of the datasets into the `train` and `test` folders within the project directory.
3. Open and run the `svm.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Usage
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed.
- Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Issues
If you encounter any issues or have questions about this project, please feel free to open an issue on this repository.
